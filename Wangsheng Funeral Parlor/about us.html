		<h2> About Us</h2>

			<p> The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor dates back to the Archon War. Many know that the archon war caused the Yaksha to accumulate excessive amounts of negative karma. some of it manifested as a plague in the city of Liyue. <br/>
				<br/>

			However, multiple doctors realised that this plague spread easily through comtaminated air and corpses. There were very few ways for the people of Liyue Harbour to safely give closure to their dead relatives at the time, and, since the people were suffering from illnesses, they often did not dispose of the sickness properly. <br/>

			<br/>

			The first owners of the Wangsheng funeral parlor came to the realisation that the plague could be contained  by burning the infected corpses and purifying the air in Liyue. Over the years, they have become a staple buisness and help maintain the balance between life and death to this day. <br/>
